                Right now with my status of apprentice I work for BAYER and study at ESTIA. I come from a preparatory class and a general science and engineering path in Highschool.

                My really first experience was an internship in a medical cabinet. I learn some basics about work and the interaction with others. </bn>
                Then I worked during the summer vacacions in a general store in the pastry alley. It was a good learning opportunity because it wasn't easy. 
                And now I work for BAYER, I plan, help and make report about the maintenance of the machines.

               I love robotics and video games. During my free time, I read, draw or just do anything that entertain me. The best gift someone could give me is a small scale model of a car/boat or any mechanical object that need to be constructed. It's even better than a puzzle;
